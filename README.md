# flappyBirdClone

#### A Flappy Bird clone written using CreateJS, RequireJS, whenjs, underscore, and Radio.js

Yeah, there are a lot of Flappy Bird clones out there. Tutorials and examples abound. However, I'm
hoping this example project will showcase some modern best practices for game development, utilizing
some cool techniques and libraries while still being easy to understand.  


The source material and original inspiration for this sample was gleaned from Jose Ignacio Amelivia at:

He's constantly updating his repo, so it's probably a good idea to check it out and see how he's
accomplished some of the same things I have, but using different tactics.
